UML: Unifed Modeling Language


Diagram Types :

[Structure]
    - Composite:
    - Deployment: models physical aspects of objects
    - Package: shows packages and dependencies between them
    - Profile
    - Class
    - Object: shows details of a systems state at a specific point in time
    - Component


[Behavioral]
    - Activity: graphic representations of workflows
    - Use Case
    - State: describes system behavior
    - Interaction+ sequence, communication, interaction overview, timing


These can help examine the system at different angles. There are often many collaborators on a system that all care about different aspects.
